## Bogo Sort

- In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm.  
- The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting.  
- rand.shuffleでランダム生成をし続けるだけ．
