## Bogo Sort

- In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, or slowsort) is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm.  
- The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting.  
- rand.shuffleでランダム生成をし続けるだけ．

## Bubble Sort
- Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use
